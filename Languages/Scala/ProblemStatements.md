Write an algorithm to help Andy find the number of customers that will be given discounts. <br>
Input:The first line consists of an integer numOfCust, representing the number of customers whose bills are selected for the promotional discount (N). <br>
The second line consists of N space-separated Integers bill1, bill2, bill3.. representing the bill amounts of the N customers selected for the promotional discount.<br>
7 <br>
10 20 16 25 30 40 36 <br>
Output:print an integer representing the number of customers that will be given discounts.<br>
3
#### Question 2:
You are given a list of integers and integer k. Write an algorithm to find the number of elements in the list which are strictly less than k.Input:The first line of Input consists of two space separated integers - size and numK, representing the number of elements in the list (N) and the integer to be compared (K). The second line consists of N space separated integers - element[0], element[1].. element[N-1] representing the list of integers. <br>
5 40 <br>
10 20 30 40 50 <br>
Output:Print an integer representing the number of elements in the list which are strictly less than num.3


#### Question 3:
Given a sentence of words we need to reverse it with 3 variations. <br>
Input: <br>
hello how are you <br>
Output: <br>
uoy era woh olleh (reverse the sentence literally)<br>
